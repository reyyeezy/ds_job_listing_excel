The attached file includes an excel file containing data science job postings from Glassdoor.

With the following guiding questions, we cleaned and manipulated the data before analysis.

## Guiding Questions
1. Can you make the salary column into integers? Find the min,max,avg.
2. What information can you extract out of job descriptions?
3. Can you clean and remove numbers from company names?
4. How can you create new features? (e.g. state column from the location column, company age from year founded)
